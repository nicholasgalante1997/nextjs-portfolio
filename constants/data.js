  whatsUpText: `Hey, didn't see you there. My name's Nick Galante. Here's a bit on me that has nothing to do with programming. My favorite book is Catch-22. I think Heller's passages on Milo Minderbinder show that there are in fact gods living amidst mere mortals disguised as mess privates with international syndicates. Cool, my favorite movie is Pulp Fiction, but I will accept verbal arguments on behalf of The Wolf Of Wall Street or the Gifted with Chris Evans and McKenna Grace. Lastly, I have an unnatural affinity for astrophysics, I have written Neil Degrasse Tyson several letters (which has led to a beautiful and incredible friendship (ha NOT! have not gotten a single response.)). `,
