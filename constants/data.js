      `I first transitioned into Software Engineering in 2020, through attending Flatiron's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp. It was awesome.`,
      `I've helped a few start ups get their legs underneath them, and build products that they can happily and proudly take to market.`,
      `I also led a successful project with Infosys, working to help automate the internal disconnect process for a multi billion dollar telecommunications company.`,
      `Now, I'm lucky enough to have my dream job, working with some amazing engineers at Amazon Gaming.`
